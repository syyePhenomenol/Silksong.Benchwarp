## Unresolved Notes

Anything that doesn't have ObstacleSaveInfo likely also needs permant obstacle handling.

The following areas have obstacles unhandled to some extent.

### Bone_Bottom
    - Bonegrave__door1: Still needs permanent obstacle handling. Need to handle door staying open when entering from any transition.
    - Bonegrave__left1: Still needs permanent obstacle handling.

### The_Abyss
    - Abyss_02b__top1: Missing permanent obstacle handling (the PersistentBoolItem uses the ID of an object in Abyss_11).
    - Abyss_03__door1/door2: Still need permanent obstacle handling.

### Lost_Verdania
    - Clover_04b__door1: Still needs permanent obstacle handling.

### Putrified_Ducts
    - Aqueduct_05__door2: Both NoSave and permanent handling needs to be done. Complicated because of the additive scenes.

### Far_Fields
    - Bone_East_11__right1: interaction with the left side transition/the bridge is unhandled in NoSave behaviour.
    - Bone_East_16__right1 / Bone_East_17b__left1: two way breakable wall, but controlled by two separate PersistentBoolItems?

### Deep_Docks
    - Dock_12__door1: complex handling needed for Permanent behaviour.

### Greymoor
    - Greymoor_08__door1: Both NoSave and permanent handling needs to be done. Complicated because of the additive scenes.
    - Greymoor_08__door2: Both NoSave and permanent handling needs to be done. Complicated because of the additive scenes.

### Unknown
    - Room_Caravan_Spa__left1: map/titled area and flipped transition would depend on current position of flea caravan.

### Halfway_Home
    - Halfway_01__bot1: If the vintage nectar gauntlet hasn't been completed, the hatch will appear and stay open. If the vintage nectar gauntlet was previously cleared, the hatch closes off and the conversation with Creige happens every time.

### Blasted_Steps
    - Coral_Judge_Arena__door2: Both NoSave and permanent handling needs to be done. Complicated because of the additive scenes.

### Wisp_Thicket
    - Wisp_03__door1: door closes behind Hornet. Keep it open as a transition fix?

### The_Cradle
    - Tube_Hub: Act 3 blocked transitions are handled by reverting world state to pre-Act 3. Might be a better way to handle it?

### Cogwork_Core
    - Cog_Dancers__bot1: collider obstacle, if Cogwork Dancers isn't defeated. Not handled whatsoever at the moment due to the Cogwork Dancers boss being affected.
    - Cog_Dancers__bot2: collider obstacle, if Cogwork Dancers isn't defeated. Not handled whatsoever at the moment due to the Cogwork Dancers boss being affected.

### Shellwood
    - Shellwood_25__door1: Game saving on entry still unhandled. Needs permanent obstacle handling (keep door open when entering scene from all transitions)

### The_Marrow
    - Bone_11b__top1: An Animator normally moves the blocking platform to the middle of the room. Currently unhandled for NoSave.
    - Bone_10__door2: Still needs permanent obstacle handling.

### Whiteward
    - Ward_03__door1: Needs permanent obstacle handling (normally checks quest progress).
    - Ward_06__bot1: Fully unhandled for now, because entering the scene this way forces Hornet into a hazard.

The following gates involve a lot of complex objects (FSMs etc.) and have largely been unhandled.

### Doors with missing targets
    - Ant_19__door_memoryEnd: Gives the player Beast Crest and saves the game. The HUD isn't correct (doesn't show Beast Crest flair), but the crest is active and also appears in inventory. The screen is black if you already have Beast Crest.
    - Ant_Queen__door_wakeOnGround: the game saves.
    - Aqueduct_05__door_caravanTravelEnd: Arrives at left1 instead, because the door is in the "caravan" additive scene.
    - Arborium_Tube__door_tubeEnter, and every other Ventrica arrival: No permanent handling.
    - Belltown_basement__door_fastTravelExit, and every other Bell Beast arrival: Instead of the animation of Hornet leaping out of the bells, she appears in front of the pedestal.

    - Clover_01__door_wakeOnGround: Immediately enters conversation with Green Prince if not already triggered. Enters a funny state where Hornet can move during conversation. The game saves.
    - Cog_Dancers__door_arriveFromTower: black screen.
    - Coral_10__left_firstEntrance: Collider obstacle.
    - Coral_Judge_Arena__door_caravanTravelEnd: Hornet appears in the middle of the room and cannot move.
    - Coral_Tower_01__door_wakeOnGround: the game saves.
    - Greymoor_08__door_caravanTravelEnd: arrives via right1 instead, because the door is in the "caravan" additive scene.
    - Greymoor_20c__door_memoryEnd: Gives the player Reaper Crest and saves the game. The HUD isn't correct (doesn't show Reaper Crest flair), but the crest is active and also appears in inventory. The screen is black if the player already has Reaper Crest.
    - Last_Dive__door_cutscenePosition: cutscene plays and player arrives in Abyss_Cocoon, as per normal.
    - Last_Dive_Return__door_cutscenePosition: cutscene plays and player arrives in Abyss_Cocoon, as per normal.
    - Memory_Red__door_wakeInRedMemory_Root: plays a cutscene, gives the player Everbloom and arrives in Tut_04 like usual.

    - Shellwood_25b__door_curseSequenceEnd: Gives the player the cursed Crest and saves the game.
    - Slab_03__door_slabCaged: Hornet appears in the cage as per getting captured normally, but isn't naked when broken out of the cage. The game then saves. The screen is black if the cage sequence was already triggered before.
    - Slab_10b__door_wakeOnGround: The game saves.
    - Song_Enclave__door_act3_wakeUp: Hornet talks with an invisible Sherma, then quest progress is advanced and the game is saved.
    - Song_Tower_01__door_cinematicEnd: Hornet wakes up in the middle of the Lace fight, quest progress is advanced and the game is saved. Game seems to softlock if you die in the scene under certain conditions.
    - Song_Tower_01__door_cutsceneEndLaceTower: Plays cutscene (first time only) and enters Lace fight.
    - Tut_04__door_memoryEnd: Gives and equips the Shaman crest, then saves the game. The screen is black if the player already has Shaman Crest.
    - Tut_04__door_ritualEnd: Arrives at right1 instead.
    - Tut_05__door_memoryEnd: Gives and equips the Shaman crest, then saves the game. The screen is black. The HUD isn't correct (doesn't show Reaper Crest flair), but the crest is active and also appears in inventory.
    - Under_20__door_memoryEnd: Gives the player Architect Crest and saves the game. The HUD isn't correct (doesn't show Architect Crest flair), but the crest is active and also appears in inventory. The screen is black if the player already has Architect Crest.

The following areas have not been handled at all:

### The_Slab
    - Slab_10c__door1: collider obstacle (door locked by numerous chains).
    - Slab_16__door1: arrives at bot1 instead. Existence of door1 seems to depend on Broodmother quest (should be checked).
    - Slab_23__right1: collider obstacle. Gate is shut and the arena starts.

### Choral_Chambers
    - Song_01__bot1: collider obstacle.
    - Song_01c__left1: collider obstacle.

### Bilewater
  - Bellway_08: game softlocks if door warping to this scene during Act 3 if bell beast fast travel isn't unlocked.
  - Shadow_04 missing a transition into the mist
  - Shadow_05[left1] and Dust_06[right1] put you behind a breakable wall and not visible. You can still break it though
  - Shadow_08[left1] and Shadow_27[right1] need lots of crap removed
    - _08 has breakable walls that need to be broken
    - _27 has a solid wall unless the b-wall in _08 is broken
  - Shadow_09[left3] puts you behind a breakable wall, you can break but you're invisible
  - Shadow_10[bot1] you're invisible unless a nearby b-wall is broken
  - Shadow_15[right2] is fine, but if you go further into the room there's a visual mask unless you've sat on the trap bench. Probably no action needed
  - Shadow_19[right2] is blocked off, I believe only opened by the Shakra quest
  - Shadow_22[topi] correctly maps to Library_07[boti] for i=1,2,3 but they're the same one-way drop transition
  - Shadow_Weavehome should be Weavenest Murglin titled area-wise

### High Halls

    - _03 puts you behind a gate
    - _10 puts you behind a b-wall and clipped into the floor
  - Walking into Hang_06_bank[left1] (when the simple key hasn't been used on the other side) crashed my game, not sure how reproducible this is. Doorwarping to Hang_06[door1] was fine.
  - Hang_07[left1] and Song_11[right2] are blocked unless the lever in Song_11 has been hit
  - Hang_07[top1] is blocked unless the lever in Hang_06[bot1] has been hit - doorwarping to Hang_06[bot1] was fine though.
  - Hang_08__left3: collider obstacle.
  - Hang_08[right1] is blocked unless the sentinel quest has started (I believe) - this is a blocked wall, not the metal thingy (which goes away when you catch the clawline ring, and I believe is far enough away from the transition to be fine as-is)
  - Hang_08[right2] does not exist, and warping there puts you at a different transition. Its partner, Cog_11_Destroyed[left1], softlocks the game when you try to warp there.
  - Hang_16[door1] needs special handling in act 3 mode
  - Hang_01 and Hang_07 are in the Choral Chambers titled/map area
